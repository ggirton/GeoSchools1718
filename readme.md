This is a project to get the locations of the public private and post-
secondary schools of the U.S. into 1 file.

And then to get some classroom and teacher data for the public schools

and after that to get the elevation above sea level
of schools in NC's 3rd congressional district
in which is located Kill Devil Hills, 
site of the Wright Brothers first flight.
